\section{Conclusion}

By and large, it was an inspiring and exciting experience to engage with deep learning through the use of fine art photography. Since the topic is highly complex and abstract, and the project was very extensive, it was unfortunately not feasible to go into every detail in depth. Therefore, I am still not able to cover every aspect of CNNs fully. However, it has awakened interest and the desire to continue to study the topic of deep learning.
