\section{Conclusion}

By and large, it was an inspiring and exciting experience to engage with deep learning through the use of fine art photography. Since the topic is highly complex and abstract, and the project was very extensive, it was unfortunately not feasible to go into every detail in depth. Therefore, I am still not able to understand and cover every aspect of CNNs fully. However, it has awakened interest and the desire to continue to study the topic of deep learning.

\section{Outlook}

In a future work one could for example train a model on images from one photographer and test it on images from another photographer which contain the same classes of objects in it. From a technical point of view it would be interesting to decrease the computation time of the inference as much as possible, either by using a GPU-powered environment for deployment or by using a lighter model that provides sufficiently fast computation on CPU.
